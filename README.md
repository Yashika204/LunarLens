🌌 LunarLens: Mapping the Moon, One Crater at a Time! 🌕

LunarLens is a cutting-edge system for detecting and mapping lunar craters, merging the power of computer vision, GIS tools, and modern database management to deliver precise and interactive analysis of the Moon's surface. 🚀


🌟 What is LunarLens?

LunarLens is an innovative crater detection tool that:

🛰️ Analyzes lunar images to detect and map craters.

📍 Provides precise latitude and longitude coordinates of detected craters.


This project is designed for researchers, astronomers, and space enthusiasts looking to explore and analyze the Moon’s surface features with high accuracy.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Computer Vision: Python 3.10 + OpenCV 4.5 for image processing and template matching.

GIS Tools: QGIS 3.28 for geospatial data extraction and visualization.

MS Excel (CSV File) 

🗂️ Dataset

TMC Images: High-resolution Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC) lunar images from ISRO.

Validation Dataset: Crater datasets from the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) repository, ensuring accurate validation and comparison of detected craters. 


🚀 Key Features

🌌 Accurate Detection: Combines Template Matching, Hough Circle Transform, and Isomorphic approaches to boost detection precision.

You can see the outputs of the projects in the "OUTPUT FOLDER". The folder contains the implementation flowchart, the Accuracy table, preprocessing steps that moon crater image under goes to extract from it and then the CSV FIle as well. Out of 53 craters, 47 moon crater images have been sucessfully located on the Global Mosaic and also their coordinates have been validated via a LPO NASA Database.
